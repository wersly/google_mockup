=============

A mockup of a google search results page


~~update, as of 1.1.15:
i'm pretty much done with this page, and i'm going to leave it sit here for now / come back to finish it later. It's virtually done, with a few exceptions:
	- location services footer at the bottom of the page needs to be finished
	- right margin problem needs to be addressed
	- the 'settings' button in the top right corner of the page isn't anchored properly; as you can see, when you manipulate the size of the viewport it shifts around a bit; this isn't cool. I need to line up the center of that button with the inline list also contained within that div. this can probably be managed by positioning that button relative to that list, or applying the css 'display' attribute. i'll figure it out.
	- the inline css needs to be substituted out for an external style sheet

i'd like to get on with school, as i have many other things to practice! letting one large html project bog me down is a bad idea, particularly when i still have some new languages to tackle.
